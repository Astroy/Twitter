Estimation to make the basic connection to the api was 1h, with a more complex solution about 3.5h. I spent about 45min studying the Twitter API, how to connect and what endpoints does it have.

I reached the predicted time, however I did not have any time to apply a better design - I estimate that for a nice design and UX I would need approximately 2 more hours or about 45min if the design would be given to me just to apply it.

I have build a simple application enabling users to search the tweet texts or tweet users(giving them the outcome of the resent tweets). The base search is tweet text search, and with a click on the "settings" button more options opens up. The output is a list of tweets with images and usernames of the tweeter users who tweeted them.

I also decided to filter the results by languages in case of searching by tweets. I got the available language list via Twitter API.

For connecting with API I choose PHP with Library TwitterAPIExchange. I choose this technology because its simplicity with implementation in no time, but still it is secure since all the API authentication is happening on server side.

AngularJS code is connecting to php server via http post request.


For the code you ask to be optimised, I managed to load 45 groups under 1 second. The code is in the file optimisation.html
